# Conficker-Rewrite

A personal rewrite of the infamous Conficker virus that took a vast amount of Windows 7 computers, but now adjusted to affect macos, Linux, and Windows.  
This script features:  
- Ransomware
- C2 Payload download
- Thread-Jacking
- Ram Abuse (Through an intentional memory leak)
- Cross-Platform Keyboard checks (to replicate how Conficker attacked certain KB layouts)

## Achtung/Warning:
This program is completely unintented, and may or may-not work. I am not at fault for any damage caused by reckless usage of others. I purely wrote this for learning purposes and to test my own knowledge.
